	/*
	TODO:

	The project is effectively in three parts:

	Phase 1: Opening a file and converting it from a grid into subimages
	Phase 2: Displaying subimages in a way that allows piecing together what we want
	Phase 3: Stitching these drawn images together and saving them

	obj_menu_splitter handles Phase 1
	obj_fragment handles Phase 2
	obj_ctrl_main handles Phase 3 and links the whole lot together

	It actually works! But QOL improvement is always worth striving for.
